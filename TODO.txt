- Read song from a (text?) file
- Real ADS(R) with START_NOTE and STOP_NOTE
- Do more than notes in a pattern:
	- Per-Note instrument!!!
	- Filter
	- Bendup/bend down
	- or tie Notes
	- Adjust modulation?
- Look a little at the C64 tracker or my C64 VST for more ideas


- Write an editor?
